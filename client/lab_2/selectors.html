CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. 
This is <strong>super</strong> useful. Classes are ridiculously important, since 
they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages. Once you successfully
develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, it's relatively easy to match a document
to those rules.
